# Ballin

This is my 2nd Year Unity Project game Ballin'

It is left as is it right now due it being a project game but i may pick it up again in a different repository and make it a full fledged game.
The game uses a bunch of free assets i've found with some custom made assets (the rings for example).
The game also has controller support. Feel free to download and waste some time if you'd like
